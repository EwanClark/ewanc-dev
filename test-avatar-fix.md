# Avatar URL Update Fix - Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed
The avatar source was updating in the database but the avatar URL was not being saved when users selected "Login provider" as their avatar source.

## Root Cause
When users switched to 'provider' avatar source, the `selectedProvider` state was often empty, causing the `avatarUrl` to be set to `null` during save operations.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Profile Page Logic (`/workspace/app/profile/page.tsx`)
- Enhanced the provider case in `handleSaveChanges` to default to the first available provider if none is selected
- Automatically updates the `selectedProvider` state when defaulting occurs
- Added debugging logs to track the avatar selection process

### 2. Avatar Section Component (`/workspace/components/profile-avatar-section.tsx`)
- Added auto-selection of the first available provider when switching to provider mode
- Ensures a provider is always selected when the user chooses provider avatar source

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Case 1 - New Provider Selection:**
   - Go to profile page
   - Switch avatar source to "Login provider"
   - Verify that a provider is automatically selected
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Check browser console for debug logs
   - Verify both `avatar_source` and `avatar_url` are updated in database

3. **Test Case 2 - Provider Switch:**
   - Start with a different avatar source (upload, URL, or initials)
   - Switch to "Login provider"
   - Verify automatic provider selection
   - Save changes and verify database update

4. **Test Case 3 - Multiple Providers:**
   - If multiple OAuth providers are available
   - Test switching between different providers
   - Verify correct avatar URL is saved for each provider

## Expected Debug Output

When saving with provider avatar source, you should see console logs like:
```
Provider avatar selected: {
  providerToUse: "github",
  matchingProvider: { provider: "github", avatarUrl: "https://...", name: "..." },
  avatarUrl: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/...",
  selectedProviderBefore: ""
}

Sending profile update: {
  name: "User Name",
  avatarUrl: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/...",
  avatarSource: "provider"
}

Database update result: {
  error: null,
  result: [{ id: "...", avatar_url: "https://...", avatar_source: "provider", ... }]
}
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Avatar source updates to "provider" in database
- ✅ Avatar URL updates to the correct provider avatar URL in database
- ✅ No console errors during save operation
- ✅ UI shows the correct avatar after save
- ✅ Provider is automatically selected when switching to provider mode
